# CS3560-Object-Oriented-Design-and-Programming-Fall-2022-Group-1
The topic of the presentation is design pattern. In our course, we have covered several patterns
in the GoF book. Your job is to present a new pattern from the book. I will randomly assign a
pattern to every team. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
The presentation should include: 1) the background, overview and theories about the pattern; 2)
a running code example that applies the design pattern; 3) a real-world non-CS analogy of the
pattern, something like the dating design patterns:

Here are the simple requirements:
1. Please be very clear and concise. The presentation should be no more than 7mins,
plus 2 min for questions.
2. You need to have Google slides (no more than 5 slides) for your presentation and email
me the slides link after presentation. You will decide the content of the slides, with the
goal of teaching a design pattern in an interesting and fun way.
3. The code examples are generally more important than the slides. We want to see live
code demos. You donâ€™t have to do live coding or write your own code, but we definitely
want to see something runnable and interesting. Make sure checkin the code into
GitHub and email me the repo links after the demo.
4. Make sure the team works together. The last slide should talk about the specific
contribution of each team member.
